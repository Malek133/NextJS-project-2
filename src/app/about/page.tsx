      We can't solve every use case, but in the spirit 
      of create-react-app, we can try to provide some 
      tools that abstract over the setup process and 
      handle the most common use cases, as well as 
      include some useful utilities that will let 
      the user simplify their application code.
    Redux Toolkit also includes a powerful data fetching 
    and caching capability that we've dubbed "RTK Query". 
    It's included in the package as a separate set of entry 
     points. It's optional, but can eliminate the need 
       to hand-write data fetching logic your
     These tools should be beneficial to all Redux users. 
     Whether you're a brand new Redux user setting up your 
     first project, or an experienced user who wants 
      to simplify an existing application, Redux Toolkit 
      can help you make your Redux code better
